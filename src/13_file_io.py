"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE

with open("foo.txt") as f:
    read = f.read()
    print(read)
    f.close

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE

with open("bar.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("hello \nim \nhere")
    f.close

with open("bar.txt") as f:
    read = f.read()
    print(read)
    f.close
